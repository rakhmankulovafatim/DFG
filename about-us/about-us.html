                    <p>A social coding stack. The platform integrates with external web <br>
                        resources to grab posts. Users can ark/tag them with custom marks/<br>
                        tags. In addition, Attribot allows viewing/exporting reports based on <br>
                        user tags. Finally, Attribot provides an API to access posts from social <br>
                        networks and social media analytics for third-party applications.</p>

                <h3>Talent Radar</h3>
                <p>Talent Radar was initially designed as the Heroku-based marketing <br>
                    system for creating targeted email campaigns. Users can import data,<br>
                    filter subscribers, and schedule send-outs at a specific time and date.<br>
                    The system’s main features include the ability to track campaign<br>
                    execution progress, restart on fail, campaign A/B testing, and real-time<br>
                    campaign statistics.<br>
                    Initially, the project consisted of four separate applications based on <br>
                    Rails 3.2, a custom Ruby daemon, a socket.io app, and a Java-written <br>
                    plugin for Elasticsearch. All of them were communicating via Redis <br>
                    pub/sub sharing PostgreSQL state.<br>
                    <span class="blue">To achieve atomic and stable performance, our team rewrote 22 000 <br>lines of code. </p></span>
